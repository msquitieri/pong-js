An implementation of Pong using the HTML5 canvas element and javascript. This project was originally completed as an assignment in the course CISC 3660 | Game Programming for Professor Sklar at CUNY Brooklyn College.

# How to Play

Just use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to move the paddle.

**Note:** The Impossible difficulty actually is impossible; you will never be able to score a point under that difficulty.

Enjoy!
